## Election-Audit Summary
  This coding script can be used with virtually all elecions. As long as data is provided with a .csv file that correlates with the same categories as the Colorado Congressional election, this code will work with any election. If .csv files were to be provided with more or different columns of data, the code could easily be manipulated to accurately interpret the data provided. More candidates and counties would be added to the list automatically with the code so long as they are provided within the dataset. If a larger scale election was needed (ex. nationwide), counties could be changed to calculate states to provide an accurate count. The data could also be modified to display any data recieved such as voter prefrence based on political party.
